## Your Lemonade is Ready!

You've built something amazing - now let's put it to work! You can:

1. **Email it** – Chat with your AI right from your inbox (like having a helpful colleague on call 24/7)
2. **Add it to your website** – Give visitors instant AI-powered help without them leaving your site
3. **Sell access** – Turn your Lemonade into a business on your own domain with subscription billing

Most users start with Email deployment (it's free and takes 30 seconds). Once you're ready to share with others, explore Embed or Subscription options.

    Navigate to **Lemonades** and click on your Lemonade
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Deploy Tab">
