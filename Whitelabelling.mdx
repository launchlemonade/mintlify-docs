## Why Create a Mix?

You've built a Lemonade that works perfectly. Now what? A Mix is how you share it with the world - whether that's adding it to your website, selling subscriptions, or connecting it as a team tool.

Think of it as taking your Lemonade off the shelf and putting it somewhere people can actually use it, with your branding front and center.

## What is a Mix?

When you're ready to share your Lemonade with the world, you create a Mix. Think of it as packaging your Lemonade with your branding - ready to embed on your website or sell to customers.

A Mix lets you:
- Add it as a **Chatbot** on your website
- **Monetize** it by selling subscriptions
- Connect it as a **Team** tool

The key word is "whitelabeling" - that means your logo, your colors, your domain. Not ours!

## Accessing Mixes

Click **Mixes** in the top navigation bar to see all your Mixes.

- Number of chats
- **Upgrade** and **Edit** buttons

## Mix vs Deploy Options Comparison

| Option | Location | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|

| **Embed Mix** | Mixes / Deploy tab | Website chatbots |
| **Subscription Mix** | Mixes / Deploy tab | Monetization |

## Pro Tips for Your Mix

**Test first!** Chat with your Lemonade a few times before going live. Try weird questions - your future users will!

**Match your brand** - Choose colors and logos that blend seamlessly with your site. Nobody should be able to tell it's not built into your site.

**Polish your instructions** - Remember, users will interact with your Lemonade directly. Make sure your system prompt is clear and helpful.

**Watch your usage** - Check the chat count on your Mixes regularly to understand how people are using it.

## Upgrading a Mix

Click the **Upgrade** button next to any Mix to:
- Unlock premium features
- Increase usage limits
