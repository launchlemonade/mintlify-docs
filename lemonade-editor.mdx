## Your Control Center

The Lemonade Editor is your control center - where you shape your AI's personality, knowledge, and superpowers. Let's walk through each section so you know exactly what's possible.

Think of the Editor as your AI workshop. You have 7 tabs on the left side, each handling a different part of your Lemonade. Plus, there's a **"Run Lemonade"** button in the top right to test everything as you go.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Advanced: Understanding Model Settings" icon="gear">
    For power users who want fine-grained control over model behavior:

    - **Temperature**: Controls how creative vs. consistent your AI is (0.0 = same answer every time, 1.0 = maximum creativity)
    - **Max Tokens**: Limits how long responses can be (shorter = faster and cheaper, longer = more detailed)
    - **Top P**: Another way to control variety in responses (most users can ignore this)

    These settings are available in the Model tab after selecting a model.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Check Your Progress

A helpful checklist showing what your Lemonade needs to work properly.

### Mandatory Requirements (3 items)

Your Lemonade needs at minimum:
- ✅ **Connected to a Model** - Select a model in the Model tab
- ✅ **Has an Instruction** - Add instructions in the Instructions tab
- ✅ **Has a Welcome message** - Set a welcome message in the Instructions tab

### Optional Upgrades

Enhance your Lemonade with:
- 📄 Add files to enhance knowledge (and make it better than ChatGPT!)
- 🔗 Add website or other links to fine tune your Lemonade

## Set Up Instructions

This is where you give your AI its personality and job description.

<img
  src="/images/lemonade-editor/editor-instructions-01-tab.png"
  alt="Instructions tab showing Welcome Message and Instructions fields"
  style={{maxWidth: "600px"}}
/>

### Welcome Message

The first message sent when someone starts a chat.

**Default:** "Hello {first_name}, how can I help you today?"

<Note>
Use `{first_name}` as a placeholder to automatically insert the user's first name!
</Note>

**Tips for good welcome messages:**
- Be friendly and inviting
- Briefly explain what the Lemonade can help with
- Ask an open-ended question to start the conversation

**Examples:**
```text
"Hi {first_name}! I'm your personal marketing assistant. What can I help you create today?"

"Welcome! I'm here to answer your questions about our products. What would you like to know?"

"Hey {first_name}! Ready to brainstorm some ideas? Let's get started!"
```

### Instructions

This is where you give your AI its personality and job description. Think of it like hiring someone - you're writing their role and guidelines.

<Note>
Developers call this a "system prompt" - now you know the lingo!
</Note>

**Default:** "You are a helpful chatbot"

**Tips for good instructions:**
- Be specific about the Lemonade's role
- Define its personality and tone
- Set boundaries on topics
- Include any specific knowledge or context

**Example:**
```text
You are a customer support assistant for TechCorp, a software company.

Your responsibilities:
- Answer questions about our products
- Help troubleshoot common issues
- Guide users to relevant documentation
- Escalate complex issues to human support

Tone: Professional but friendly. Use simple language.

Important: Never share pricing information. Direct pricing questions to sales@techcorp.com
```
