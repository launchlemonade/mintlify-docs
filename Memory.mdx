## Why Memory Matters

Your LaunchLemonade Lemonades get smarter and more helpful when they remember key facts about you, your brand, and your work. Good memory means fewer repeats, faster results, and a more personal experience.

## Understanding Brain vs Knowledge

LaunchLemonade has two ways to give your Lemonades information:

| Feature | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Brain** | Profile & Billing → Brain tab | Account-wide memory that can be shared across multiple Lemonades |
| **Knowledge** | Lemonade Editor → Knowledge tab | Lemonade-specific files, websites, and integrations |

## Setting Up Your Brain

The Brain feature lets you organize your knowledge into separate contexts that any Lemonade can access.

### Accessing the Brain

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Profile & Billing">
    Click **Profile & Billing** in the top navigation bar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the Brain Tab">
    Click the **Brain** tab (6th tab, with globe icon)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Brain">
    Make sure the **Enabled** toggle is turned on (green)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Creating Multiple Brains

You can organize your knowledge into separate brains for different contexts:

- Click **"+ Add New Brain"** to create a new brain
- Each brain has its own tab (e.g., "Dyslexic", "test")
- Switch between brains by clicking on their tabs

### Adding Memory to a Brain

Simply type or paste information into the text area. Each brain stores its own memories and information, helping you keep different contexts separate and organized.

**Example entries:**
```text
"My name is Dan. I'm dyslexic and prefer responses in clear bullet points."
"My company name is Acme Corp and we sell widgets."
"Always respond in a friendly, professional tone."
```

### Linking Brain to a Lemonade

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Lemonade">
    Go to **Lemonades** and click on a Lemonade to edit it
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Details Tab">
    Click the **Details** tab in the Lemonade editor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Brain">
    Use the **Brain** dropdown to select which brain context to use
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The Brain feature is marked as **NEW** in the Details tab!
</Note>

## Adding Knowledge to Individual Lemonades

For Lemonade-specific knowledge, use the Knowledge tab:

### Accessing Knowledge

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Lemonade Editor">
    Click on any Lemonade from your dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Knowledge Tab">
    Click the **Knowledge** tab (4th tab)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Adding Files

Click **"Add Files"** to upload documents:
- PDFs, Word documents, spreadsheets
- The files will be processed and your Lemonade can reference them

### Adding Websites

Click **"Add Websites"** to teach from web content:
- Enter any URL
- Your Lemonade will crawl and learn from the content

### Integrations

Connect external sources:
- **Notion** – Connect your Notion workspace
- **Google Drive** – Connect your Google Drive files

## Remember All Conversations

Want your Lemonade to remember every chat automatically?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Add On Tab">
    Open your Lemonade and click the **Add On** tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Memory">
    Toggle on **"Remember all conversations with this Lemonade"**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
This remembers ALL conversations. It does not change your instructions—it only allows the Lemonade to recall previous chats.
</Warning>

## Saving Individual Insights

During any chat, you can save specific responses to memory:

1. Find a response you want to save
2. Click the **brain 🧠 icon** below the response
3. The insight is saved directly to that Lemonade's memory

This is perfect for keeping important decisions, facts, or answers without enabling full conversation memory.

## What Makes Good Memory Content?

For best results, focus on core facts, preferences, and principles:

### About You (the User)
