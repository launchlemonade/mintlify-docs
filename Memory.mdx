### **Why Memory Matters**

Your LaunchLemonade agent gets smarter and more helpful when it remembers key facts about you, your brand, and your work. Good memory means fewer repeats, faster results, and a more personal experience.

### **Three Ways to Add Memory on LaunchLemonade**

1. **Direct Entry**
   - Navigate to your account brain. Go to Profile and Billing \> Brain \> Add Memory
   - **Type, paste, or copy** in anything you want your AI to remember. (You can copy and paste your ChatGPT memory so all the LLMs Remember you. [Here’s how.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9Dd0HZa6o4)
   - _Tip: Use clear statements—e.g. “Our company vision is…” or “My biggest client is…”_
2. **Remember All Chats**
   - Now, give each lemonade and give them long term memory.
   - Select a lemonade, go to Add On then,
   - **Switch ON the “Remember All Conversations” toggle**.
   - Now, everything you discuss will be added to memory (unless you choose to delete it later).
3. **Save Individual Insights**
   - During any chat, **click the brain 🧠 icon** below a response to save that message directly to your agent’s memory (if you would like the response to be saved.
   - Perfect for keeping important decisions, facts, or answers.
