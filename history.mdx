## History vs Memory

Quick clarification: History is for you to review past chats. But your Lemonade won't automatically remember these conversations unless you turn on "Remember All Conversations" in the Add On tab.

Think of it this way: **History is your diary, Memory is your Lemonade's diary.**

| Feature | History | Remember All Conversations |
|---------|---------|---------------------------|
| What it does | Stores chat logs for you to review | Makes the Lemonade recall past chats |
| Location | History page | Add On tab in Editor |
| Affects AI | No | Yes |
