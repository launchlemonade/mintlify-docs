title: "Embedding a Voice AI with LaunchLemonade"
description: "This guide walks you through creating and embedding a voice-enabled AI experience using LaunchLemonade. While LaunchLemonade itself doesn't directly handle the speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion, it empowers you to build the AI logic and integrate it with voice services."

**I. Core AI Logic (Building Your Lemonade)**

1. **Define the Purpose:** What will your Voice AI do? (e.g., Customer support, interactive story, information retrieval). A clear purpose is crucial for effective design.

2. **Create Your Lemonade:** Log in to LaunchLemonade and create a new Lemonade.

3. **Choose Voice AI and then c**hoose the voice you would like to use (don't worry you can change this anytime after).

4. **Craft Instructions:** Provide clear instructions to your AI model. This defines how it responds to user voice input. For example:




   `You are a friendly customer support assistant `**`for`**`  [Your Company Name].  Answer questions about our products and services.  `**`If`**` you don't know the answer, say "I'm still learning about that, but I'll find out for you."`




5. **Add Knowledge (Optional):** If your Voice AI needs specific information, upload relevant files or link to knowledge bases.

6. **Test Thoroughly:** Use LaunchLemonade's testing interface to refine your Lemonade's responses. Ensure it understands and responds appropriately to various phrasings and questions.





   **II. Embedding in a Website or App**

7. Go to my mix and select voice Embed.&#x20;

8. Whitelabel and design

9. Use the src code to embed your VOICE AI on your website.
