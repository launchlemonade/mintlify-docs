## Uploading Knowledge (Files & Documents)

### What is the Knowledge Base?

The Knowledge Base allows you to upload documents or extract information from webpages to enhance your AI copilot's understanding. You can add PDFs, text files, JSON scripts, and scrape single web pages to provide context for better responses.

***

## Uploading Files to the Knowledge Base

### Supported File Types:

* **PDF (.pdf)**

* **Text files (.txt, .md)**

* **Microsoft Word (.docx)**

* **CSV & Excel (.csv, .xlsx)** (For structured data)

* **JSON files (.json)** (For structured scripting and data storage)

### How to Upload Files:

1. **Go to Your Lemonade and select "Knowledge" tab**: Navigate to the lemonade want to add knowledge to.

2. **Click on "Knowledge"**: This option appears in the customization menu.

3. **Select "Add File"**: Choose from your local storage. Unlimited amount of files,   50MB each file.

4. **Confirm Upload**: The document(s) will be processed and indexed.

**Best Practices:**

## Using the Web Scraping Tool (Scrapes One Page at a Time)

### What Does the Web Scraping Tool Do?

This feature allows you to extract text from a **single webpage** at a time and add it to your lemonade’s knowledge.

### How to Scrape a Webpage:

1. **Go to "Knowledge" Tab in Lemonade**&#x20;

2. **Select "Add website"**

3. **Enter the URL of the Page You Want to Scrape.**

4. **Click "Extract."** The tool will fetch the text from the page.

5. **Review & Save.** Edit the extracted text if necessary, then save it to your copilot's knowledge base.

**Best Practices:**

* **Scrape Only Public Pages**: Avoid private or login-protected content.

* **Check Content Relevance**: Ensure the page content aligns with your copilot’s needs.

* **Combine With Other Knowledge Sources**: Enhance results by supplementing web scrapes with PDFs, JSON files, or structured data.

* **Update Scrapes Regularly**: Websites change; re-scrape periodically for fresh data.
