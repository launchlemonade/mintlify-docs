## Why Knowledge Matters

Want your Lemonade to know YOUR business? The Knowledge tab is where you share your documents, websites, and data - so your AI can give answers specific to you, not generic internet responses.

Good knowledge makes your Lemonade smarter, more accurate, and genuinely helpful for your unique needs.

## Accessing Knowledge Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Lemonade Editor">
    Navigate to **Lemonades** and click on your Lemonade
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Knowledge Tab">
    Click the **Knowledge** tab in the editor
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Three Ways to Add Knowledge

### 1. Add Files

Upload documents directly to train your Lemonade.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Files">
    Click the **"Add Files"** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Documents">
    Choose files from your computer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Processing">
    Files are automatically processed and ready to use
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Supported File Types:**

| Format | Extension | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| PDF | .pdf | Manuals, reports, ebooks |
| Word | .docx | Documents, SOPs |
| Text | .txt | Simple text content |
| CSV | .csv | Data tables, lists |
| Excel | .xlsx | Spreadsheets |

<Tip>
Break large documents into smaller, focused files for better results. A 100-page manual should be split into logical sections.
</Tip>

### 2. Add Websites

Crawl and learn from web content.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Websites">
    Click the **"Add Websites"** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter URL">
    Paste the website URL you want to crawl
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Crawl">
    Choose how many pages to crawl
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Crawl">
    Click to begin. Content is processed automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Great for:**
- Product documentation
- FAQ pages
- Help center articles
- Blog content
- Company information

<Warning>
Only crawl websites you own or have permission to use. When in doubt, stick to your own content!
</Warning>

### 3. Integrations

Connect external data sources directly.

| Integration | Description | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Notion** | Connect your Notion workspace | Team wikis, documentation |
| **Google Drive** | Connect your Drive files | Shared documents, spreadsheets |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How to Connect Integrations">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Choose Integration">
        Click on the integration you want to connect
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Access">
        Follow the prompts to connect your account (you'll see a familiar "Sign in with Google" or "Authorize" screen)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select Content">
        Choose which pages/files to sync
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>

## Knowledge vs Brain

Understanding the difference:

| Feature | Knowledge (Tab 4) | Brain (Profile & Billing) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | This Lemonade only | All your Lemonades |
| **Content** | Documents, websites | Persistent memory |
| **Use Case** | Domain expertise | Remembered facts |
| **Updates** | Manual uploads | Automatic learning |

<Note>
Use **Knowledge** for specific expertise (product docs, FAQs). Use **Brain** for things that should be remembered across all conversations. Learn more in our [Memory guide](/Memory).
</Note>

## For Best Results

**Start small** - A few focused documents work better than uploading everything at once. You can always add more later!

**Keep it fresh** - Update files when information changes. Old knowledge can lead to outdated answers.

**Remove duplicates** - Don't upload the same content multiple ways. Your AI will get confused if it sees contradicting information.

**Use clear names** - Name files descriptively so you know what's uploaded at a glance.

**Quality over quantity** - 10 well-organized pages beat 100 poorly structured ones.

### Content Quality Tips

- **Clean formatting** – Remove unnecessary headers/footers before uploading
- **Structured content** – Use headings and sections to help your AI understand the organization
- **Accurate information** – Verify facts before uploading
- **Plain language** – Avoid unnecessary jargon (unless your use case requires it)

### What NOT to Upload

- Sensitive personal data (unless necessary and secure)
- Copyrighted content you don't have rights to
- Outdated information
- Duplicate content in different formats

## Managing Knowledge

### View Uploaded Content

See all your uploaded files and websites in the Knowledge tab:
- File names and types
- Upload dates
- Processing status

### Delete Content

Remove outdated or irrelevant knowledge:
1. Find the file/website in your list
2. Click the delete icon
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
Deleting knowledge affects how your Lemonade responds immediately. Test after removing content to make sure your AI still has the information it needs.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### File Won't Upload

- Check file size (max 25MB)
- Verify file format is supported
- Try a different browser
- Contact support if issues persist

### Website Won't Crawl

- Verify the URL is accessible
- Check if the site allows crawling
- Try a specific page instead of the homepage
- Ensure HTTPS is used

### Knowledge Not Being Used

- Verify the file/website processed successfully
- Check that your Instructions reference the knowledge
- Ask questions directly related to the uploaded content
- Re-upload if necessary
